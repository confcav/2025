Time: 12pm-1pm

Venue: CAV 2025 (Zagreb, Croatia)

#### Are AI minds genuine minds?

The question "Are AI minds genuine minds?" invites us to examine the nature of mind itself and whether artificial intelligence meets its defining criteria. A genuine mind is typically associated with consciousness, self-awareness, intentionality, and the capacity to experience mental states such as emotions. Whether AI qualifies as possessing a true mind ultimately depends on how we define the essential qualities of consciousness and intelligence. This question lies at the heart of the discussion.

#### Organizers

The LogicLounge is hosted by the [37rd International Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV)](https://conferences.i-cav.org/2025/) and organized by [Bettina Könighofer](https://www.isec.tugraz.at/person/bettina-koenighofer/) in collaboration with the [Vienna Center for Logic and Algorithms at TU Wien (VCLA)](https://www.vcla.at/) and supported by [Roderick Bloem](https://www.isec.tugraz.at/person/roderick-bloem/) and [Georg Weissenbacher](https://www.georg.weissenbacher.science/). 

#### About the LogicLounge series

The series of [public lectures LogicLounge](https://www.vcla.at/logiclounge/) continues to bring together the general public and the experts from the fields of logic, philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Since its inception at the [Vienna Summer of Logic](http://vsl2014.at/) in 2014 – the largest event in the history of logic – the series has since been traveling between Vienna and the venue of the [CAV](https://i-cav.org/2020/logic-lounge/) (International Conference on Computer-Aided Verification), where it has already become a regular event in honor of Prof. Helmut Veith (1971-2016).

#### Sponsor
This year's LogicLounge was kindly sponsored by [Stiftung SIC](https://jce.isec.tugraz.at/).
