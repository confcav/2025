Date: July 21

The purpose of the Verification Mentoring Workshop (VMW) is to provide mentoring and career advice to senior undergraduate and junior researchers at all stages, and to attract them to pursue research careers in the area of computer-aided verification. The workshop will particularly encourage the participation of women and underrepresented minorities.

The workshop program will include a number of talks and interactive sessions. The talks will give an overview of the field along with brief introductions to the varied CAV related topics. Other talks will provide mentoring and career advice, from academia and industry.
