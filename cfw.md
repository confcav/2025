Part II: Organizational Information
* Contact information of the workshop organizers
* Main contact for the workshop (i.e., a workshop chair)
* Desired length of the workshop (one or two days)
* Estimate of the audience size

* Plans for dissemination, if any (e.g., special issues of journals)
* Special technical, AV, or USB stick needs
* Links to a preliminary website of the workshop and call for papers (if possible)

#### EVALUATION CRITERIA
The workshop proposals will be reviewed and evaluated on the following criteria:
* Potential to advance the state of the art in verification technologies
