#### Banquet Venue
Due to unforeseen construction work on the tram tracks in the direction of the
Mihaljevac station, it will not be possible to reach the [Okrugljak restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UcSTWViu3Dp4K1dQ8) by tram
during the CAV conference.

The easiest and most time-efficient option to reach the banquet venue from the Westin Hotel is by taxi/Uber. However, if you would prefer to use public transit instead, we also provide detailed instructions below.

Instead, the city activated an additional bus line, no. 613 (timetable of the bus line on
the [link](https://www.zet.hr/UserDocsImages/Raspored%20izvanrednih%20linija%20u%20prome
tu/613.pdf)) which runs from the Kaptol station (stop near the Zagreb Cathedral) to the
Mihaljevac station (and further to the Gračansko Polje station), every 10 minutes.

There are two options for getting to the bus line no. 613 at Kaptol.
* The first one is on foot (about 25 minutes) from Westin to Kaptol, via Josip Jelačić
Square.
* The second is by any tram from the stop near Westin (lines to Josip Jelačić Square: 12,
13, 14, 17) and then on foot from Josip Jelačić Square to Kaptol (about 15 minutes
total).

After arriving at the Mihaljevac station, which is closest to Okrugljak, the Okrugljak
restaurant itself can be reached by a 10-minute walk (slightly uphill).

In total, you should count on a trip of about 50 minutes before the banquet, which starts
in Okrugljak at 19:00.

The elaboration of the path to Okrugljak from Westin:
- 5 minutes from Westin to the tram station “Trg Rep. Hrvatske” (waiting for the tram is
not counted because the trams arrive often)
- 5 minutes by tram to Josip Jelačić Square (2 stops)
- 5 minutes’ walk to Kaptol
- 20-25 minutes by bus to Mihaljevac (including waiting time for up to 1 bus)
- 10 minutes walk from Mihaljevac to Okrugljak

Buses from Mihaljevac back to Kaptol run until midnight every 10 minutes.

The alternative are taxis from Westin directly to Okrugljak, the price of which is in the
order of 15 euros per ride (if there are more participants, the price can be divided) and
the expected time for the arrival of taxi to Okrugljak is 15-20 minutes.
